# 2. History of match-fixing in football

It is a widely held belief that professional football matches are a fair representation of players' skills and abilities competing against one another. Unfortunately, this is not always the case, and in many instances, matches have been marred by match-fixing scandals.

Match-fixing is the act of intentionally manipulating the outcome of a sporting event for personal gain. This can be done in several ways, such as paying a player to underperform, paying a referee or official to favor one team over another, or even fixing the outcome of a game before it has been played.

Football has a long history of match-fixing, and there have been many high-profile cases over the years. One of the most notorious cases was the "Calciopoli" scandal in Italy, where several top teams were found guilty of match-fixing and were subsequently relegated or docked points.

Match-fixing is not confined to a specific region or country. There have been cases in Asia, Europe, South America, and even Africa. It is a problem that affects football at all levels - from the grassroots to the highest echelons of professional football.

As we move forward in this book, we will explore the various methods that have been used to rig football matches and examine some of the most significant cases of match-fixing in football history. By understanding how match-fixing has been carried out in the past, we can better understand how it could occur in a high-pressure event like the World Cup final.
