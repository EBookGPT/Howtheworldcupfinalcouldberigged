Welcome to the final chapter of our book on how the World Cup Final could be rigged. Throughout this book, we have discussed various ways through which the integrity of the World Cup Final could be compromised. We have also explored possible preventative measures to protect the game. As we wrap up our discussion, let us take a moment to reflect on the insights we have gained.

We were honored to have FIFA's Chief Investigator, [insert name], in our studio to talk to us about the measures FIFA is taking to combat match-fixing. [Insert name] shared an in-depth perspective on the challenges that FIFA has faced in this area. For instance, he explained how the proliferation of technology has made it easier for fixers to commit offenses while making it harder for investigators to detect these crimes.
