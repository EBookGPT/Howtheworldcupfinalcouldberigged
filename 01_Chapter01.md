Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I am not aware of the specific code that could be used to resolve potential instances of World Cup final rigging. The methods and techniques used to detect and prevent fraud in sporting events like the World Cup can be complex and vary depending on the situation.

However, here are some general strategies that could be employed:

1. Tracking and analyzing odds: One method utilized by bookmakers to detect suspicious betting activity is by tracking the movement of odds. If there is a sudden spike in betting activity on a specific outcome, it could be an indicator of irregularities.

2. Performing Background Checks: Background checks conducted on referees, players and other key individuals involved in the event can identify if any of them have a history of bribery or other corrupt activities.

3. Statistical Analysis: Performing a statistical analysis of the game and its components, including patterns in scoring or fouls, could be indicators of potential rigging.

4. Collaboration with Law Enforcement Agencies: Collaboration with law enforcement agencies and antifraud organizations, like Interpol, can help to identify any criminal organizations or individuals that may attempt to rig the World Cup final.

By employing these strategies, we can help ensure that the World Cup final remains a fair and transparent event, free from corruption and rigging.
