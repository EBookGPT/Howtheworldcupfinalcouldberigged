As the chapter explores a complex and multifaceted issue, there is no specific code that can be used to resolve it. Instead, a variety of investigative techniques and preventative measures have been discussed as possible solutions.

However, it is important for any investigation and prevention efforts to make use of available technology and resources. This could involve digital forensic analysis of communication and financial records to detect potential match-fixing schemes. Data analysis and modeling techniques may also be used to identify patterns that suggest match manipulation.

In terms of preventative measures, technology has the potential to be used to increase transparency and reduce opportunities for match-fixing. For example, the use of video assistant referees (VAR) and goal-line technology can help ensure accurate officiating and reduce the potential for human error and manipulation. 

Additionally, sports betting companies can work together with governing bodies to share data and identify suspicious betting patterns that may indicate match-fixing. This allows for early intervention and prevention of potential schemes.

Ultimately, the resolution of the issue of match-fixing in football and particularly the World Cup requires a multi-faceted approach that incorporates technology, investigation, and preventative measures. It is vital to remain vigilant and committed to protecting the integrity of the sport.
